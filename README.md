# Transactions
This is a Node JS project that simulates bank transactions. You can sign in transactions with the type 'income' or 'outcome'. The app shows your account balance
and doesn't let you stay with a negative balance.

This app was built with Node.js, TypeScript, using the models (or entities), repositories, services and other software achitecture concepts.
